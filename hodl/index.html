        <h1>Namaste!</h1>
        <p>Lately, many of us have been curious about the investment world, professionally, but also on a personal level. 
        And there has been a boost in investments since the Wuhan Virus pandemic. But while people are learning about investing, portfolio theory,
        Scholes formula, Arbitrage and all the complex investment and finance stuff, this knowledge is useless unless you have a few lacs in the bank.
        Most of what we learn about is not accessible for personal investing.</p>
        <p>So I had to find other ways to put my capital to work. I started exploring investment options in 2019, options that i could
        access with limited capital. Now, I regularly have friends asking me for investment advice. And i always tell them the 
        same thing: I am not an expert, I can only point a few directions that worked for me, you can explore them by yourself.
        I won't advise anyone on what company to invest in, what stock to pick or whether it's ok for you in particular to bet 2 grand in crypto.</p>

        <h1>Is it a CRIME to make money?</h1>
        <p>Our society looks down on people who have wealth. Wehen someone asks our salary, the question stems from a sense of JUDGEMENT.
         We value people based on how much money they make. It make it difficult for both kinds of people: the ones who are well off as well 
        as those who are barely making money to be honest about their finances. As a result- Money Has Become A Taboo.
        </p>
        <p>Nobody is honest about it.
        </br>
        Nobody knows what to do.
